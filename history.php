Yet it is also one with a fascinating history: indeed, the space predates its famous neighbour at no. 36. The association of 18-22 Wigmore Street with the piano trade goes back to the late 19th century when it was constructed for John Brinsmead and Sons.</p>

This caused an obvious, and intense, pressure on the business until finally in spring 1921 John Brinsmead and Sons was declared insolvent.<br><br>In 1889, Carl Bechstein’s piano firm from Berlin chose 40 Wigmore Street as the site for its London operations. They followed their London success by establishing in 1901 a concert hall at no. 36, originally known as Bechstein Hall. However, in 1916, during the surge of anti-German sentiment that accompanied the ongoing First World War, the property was confiscated and sold to Debenham’s for £56,500. The venue reopened the following year under a new name: Wigmore Hall.<br><br>The Bechstein association has been absent from Wigmore Street ever since, but the 21st century seems to demand a new approach. With the restoration of this historic recital venue, complete with all mod cons, Wigmore Street acquires a little sister to its famous hall and restores at long last the historic link between this delectable location and the firm of Bechstein itself.<br></p>
